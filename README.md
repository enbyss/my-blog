# myblog

This is a blog I'm working on for personal reasons. I decided to use this opportunity to teach myself some 
frontend programming as well, just for fun. It's mostly powered on `Nuxt.js` and `TailwindCSS`, which are 
the two most prominent things around this whole blog. Doesn't mean they're the only ones though.

You can find my blog [~~here~~](nolink.com). (The blog doesn't exist yet.)

## Build Setup

If, for some weird reason, you want to build my own blog locally, feel free to do the following:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
