      Welcome to my humble blog. This page is currently empty, <b>particularly</b> because I don't have much of an idea for what to put on here.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the links above, a lot of them <b><i>work</i></b>, but their pages aren't fully working yet. Do forgive me, I am indeed trying to be a good host.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you like the way this page looks however. Someday I'll figure out what to put on here.
